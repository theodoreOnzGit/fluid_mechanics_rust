// to use, perhaps via an enum or something,
// then the fluid properties are automatically loaded
// perhaps for convenience i can make a trait object of sorts
// the trait object will be a dependency

// This trait will then be "inherited" and available for immediate use
// I can call it a FluidPropertyAssociatedFunctions kind of trait

// Strictly speaking, you DON'T need to use
// 
// ConstantCompositionSinglePhaseFluidPropertiesAssociatedFunctions
// trait to write code,
//
// but it may make it easier as you don't have to keep writing those
// thermophysical properties down
